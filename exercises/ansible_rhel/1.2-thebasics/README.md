## Objective

In this exercise, we are going to explore the latest Ansible command line
utility `ansible-navigator` to learn how to work with inventory files and the
listing of modules when needing assistance. The goal is to familarize yourself
with how `ansible-navigator` works and how it can be used to enrich your Ansible
experience.

## Guide

### Inventory File Basics

An inventory file is a text file that specifies the nodes that will be managed by the control machine. The nodes to be managed may include a list of hostnames or IP addresses of those nodes. The inventory file allows for nodes to be organized into groups by declaring a host group name within square brackets ([]).

### Exploring the Inventory

To use the `ansible-navigator` command for host management, you need to provide
an inventory file which defines a list of hosts to be managed from the control
node. In this lab, the inventory is provided by your instructor. The inventory
file is an `ini` formatted file listing your hosts, sorted in groups,
additionally providing some variables. An example may look as follows:

```bash
[web]
node1 ansible_host=<X.X.X.X>
node2 ansible_host=<Y.Y.Y.Y>
node3 ansible_host=<Z.Z.Z.Z>

[control]
ansible-1 ansible_host=44.55.66.77
```

To view your inventory with ansible-navigator, use the command
`ansible-navigator inventory --list -m stdout`. This command displays all nodes
and their respective groups.

```bash
[student@ansible-1 rhel_workshop]$ cd /home/student
[student@ansible-1 ~]$ ansible-navigator inventory --list -m stdout
{
    "_meta": {
        "hostvars": {
            "ansible-1": {
                "ansible_host": "3.236.186.92"            },
            "node1": {
                "ansible_host": "3.239.234.187"
            },
            "node2": {
                "ansible_host": "75.101.228.151"
            },
            "node3": {
                "ansible_host": "100.27.38.142"
            }
        }
    },
    "all": {
        "children": [
            "control",
            "ungrouped",
            "web"
        ]
    },
    "control": {
        "hosts": [
            "ansible-1"
        ]
    },
    "web": {
        "hosts": [
            "node1",
            "node2",
            "node3"
        ]
    }
}

```

NOTE: `-m` is short for `--mode` which allows for the mode to be switched to standard output instead of using the text-based user interface (TUI).

For a less detailed view, `ansible-navigator inventory --graph -m stdout` offers
a visual representation of groupings.

```bash
[student@ansible-1 ~]$ ansible-navigator inventory --graph -m stdout
@all:
  |--@control:
  |  |--ansible-1
  |--@ungrouped:
  |--@web:
  |  |--node1
  |  |--node2
  |  |--node3

```

We can clearly see that nodes: `node1`, `node2`, `node3` are part of the `web`
group, while `ansible-1` is part of the `control` group.


An inventory file can organize your hosts in groups or define variables. In our
example, the current inventory has the groups `web` and `control`. Run
`ansible-navigator` with these host patterns and observe the output:

Using the `ansible-navigator inventory` command, you can run commands that
provide information only for one host or group. For example, run the following
commands and observe their different outputs.

```bash
[student@ansible-1 ~]$ ansible-navigator inventory --graph web -m stdout
[student@ansible-1 ~]$ ansible-navigator inventory --graph control -m stdout
[student@ansible-1 ~]$ ansible-navigator inventory --host node1 -m stdout
```

> **Tip**
>
> The inventory can contain more data. e.g. if you have hosts that run on
> non-standard SSH ports you can put the port number after the hostname with a
> colon. One can also define names specific to Ansible and have them point to
> the IP or hostname.

### Module Discovery

Ansible Automation Platform comes with multiple supported Execution Environments
(EEs).  These EEs come with bundled supported collections that contain supported
content, including modules.

> **Tip**
>
> In `ansible-navigator` exit by pressing the button `ESC`.

To browse your available modules first enter interactive mode:

```bash
$ ansible-navigator
```

![picture of ansible-navigator](images/interactive-mode.png)

Browse a collection by typing `:collections`

```bash
:collections
```

### Accessing Module Documentation

To explore a specific collection's modules, enter the number next to the
collection name.

For example in the screenshot above, the number `0` corresponds to
`amazon.aws` collection.  To zoom into the collection type the number `0`.

```bash
0
```

![picture of ansible-navigator](images/interactive-aws.png)


Directly access detailed documentation for any module by specifying its
corresponding number. For
example the module `ec2_tag` corresponds to `24`.

```bash
:24
```

Scrolling down using the arrow keys or page-up and page-down can show us
documentation and examples.

![picture of ansible-navigator](images/interactive-ec2-tag.png)

You can skip directly to a particular module by simply typing `:doc
namespace.collection.module-name`.  For example typing `:doc amazon.aws.ec2_tag`
would skip directly to the final page shown above.

> **Tip**
>
> Different execution environments can have access to different collections, and different versions of those collections.  By using the built-in documentation you know that it will be accurate for that particular version of the collection.
